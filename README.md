Implementation of **Derivative Informed Neural Operators** in `jax`. Build for fast performance in single GPU environments-- and specifically where _all-data-can-fit-in-gpu-memory_. In the future, this code will be generalized for the setting in which one has multiple GPUs and would like to take advantage. It will also be generalized to account for big-data (where not all samples can fit in gpu or cpu memory).
